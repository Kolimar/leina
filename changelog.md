# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.2] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- `--help` / `-h` after a subcommand no longer gets consumed as the `<dir>` positional.
  Commands that read `<dir>` from their first argument (`status`/`stats`/`affected`/`path`/
  `query`) treated `--help` as a directory — an earlier build even created a stray
  `--help/.leina/graph.db`. The dispatcher now intercepts `--help`/`-h` and prints help, and
  those handlers reject a leading `--` token as a directory (matching `build`/`refresh`/
  `serve`/`visualize`). Covered by a 10-case regression test.

### Documentation
- Clarified that `visualize` and `graph serve` are **different tools**, not two forms of the
  same view: `visualize` exports a static, shareable `.html` file for one project; `graph serve`
  runs a live local server with a multi-project selector and per-node anchored memory. Added a
  comparison table to the getting-started guide, listed `graph serve` in the usage guide's visual
  tools (it was missing), and cross-referenced both ways in the README and CLI reference — all in
  both languages. Also translated the `graph serve` sections that were missing from the Spanish
  README and CLI reference.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- `bin.leina` in `package.json` normalized (`./dist/cli/index.js` → `dist/cli/index.js`),
  silencing the warning npm already auto-corrected at publish time. No functional change.

### Documentation
- Reoriented the install docs around the **published package**. `readme.md`,
  `GETTING_STARTED.md` and the usage guide now lead with `npm install -g @kolimar/leina` +
  `leina tui` as the primary path (a three-command Quickstart) and demote the from-a-clone
  workflow to `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The README "Usage" examples switched from the clone form
  `npm run cli -- <cmd>` to `leina <cmd>`.
- New **"Connect it to your AI"** section documenting the two integration surfaces: the
  universal **MCP server** (`leina mcp`, stdio) with a per-host registration table — Claude
  Code, Cursor, Windsurf (auto via `leina mcp register`), plus VS Code, OpenAI Codex CLI,
  Gemini CLI, LM Studio, Zed, Cline and JetBrains/Junie (manual, with each host's config
  location and format) — and the **hooks** auto-injection, now explicitly scoped to Devin and
  Claude Code (every other host calls the MCP tools on demand). Corrected the asset-link host
  list to Devin and Claude Code only (Cursor/Windsurf consume MCP, not the skills/agents share).
- Applied across both languages: `GETTING_STARTED.md` / `docs/i18n/es/getting-started.md`,
  `docs/guides/usage-guide.md` / `docs/i18n/en/usage-guide.md`, `readme.md` /
  `docs/i18n/es/index.md`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **`leina graph serve`**: a read-only, foreground HTTP server (`node:http`, zero new
  dependencies) exposing the graph + anchored memory of a project as a JSON API
  (`/api/projects`, `.../graph`, `.../stats`, `.../tree`, `.../search`, `.../nodes/:id`,
  `.../nodes/:id/memories`), plus a vanilla-JS explorer UI: the full graph renders up
  front (force layout frozen after stabilization, node size by degree, labels appear as
  you zoom), with a live search dropdown, kind/relation filter chips (structural
  `contains` off by default), a collapsible folder tree, a node drawer listing every
  incident relation in both directions as navigable groups, and drift-badged memory
  cards (title/date/preview, expandable). Binds strictly to loopback, supports an
  optional constant-time-compared auth token (`LEINA_SERVE_TOKEN`), and self-registers
  the project into a new global registry (`~/.leina/projects.json`, also upserted by
  `build`/`refresh`/`init`).
- **`leina memory reanchor`**: conservatively retro-anchors existing observations by
  extracting only explicit path/symbol references from their text and verifying each
  candidate against the live graph before minting — ambiguous or unresolved candidates are
  discarded. Additive and idempotent per `(observation_id, node_id)`; supports `--dry-run`.
- **Type + value references in the ts-morph extractor**: `affected` under-reported blast
  radius because type-only dependents (`import type`, annotations) and imported symbols used
  as values but never called produced no edges. Two new pass-2 walks emit compiler-proven
  `references` edges — type-only recall rose 4.5% → 98.2%, and interfaces like `GraphNode`
  (0 → 221 dependents) and `GraphEdge` (0 → 198) stopped reporting "nothing depends on it".

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- Concurrent multi-process access no longer fails intermittently with `SQLITE_BUSY`:
  `graph.db` and the global `memory.db` are now opened with a 5s `busy_timeout`, and
  the GraphStore constructor skips its schema DDL when the db is already stamped at
  the current version (opens used to execute write DDL on every open, colliding with
  a concurrent build). Covered by a multi-process regression test.
- Project keys no longer silently re-home when a git remote is added after `init`:
  `init` now auto-pins the derived key in `.leina/config.json` (config-lock), and
  `memory current-project`/`search`/`context` print an actionable hint when the
  resolved key has no memories but a previously-derived key does (e.g. memories
  saved under the dir-basename key before the remote existed), including the exact
  `memory merge-projects` command to recover them. `--name` writes are now
  merge-safe (sibling keys like `project_key_format` are preserved).
- Graph source discovery now skips conventionally-named minified artifacts
  (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, …): a vendored bundle used to flood the graph with
  meaningless one-letter god nodes and re-stale it on every copy. The workspace
  cross-repo scanner applies the same filter.
- Graph source discovery now skips .NET build outputs (`obj/`, `bin/`): generated
  files (`*.g.cs`, `AssemblyInfo.cs`) were indexed as sources, inflating the file
  count and re-staling the graph after every `dotnet build`. The workspace
  cross-repo scanner skips them too, matching the Roslyn sidecar's ignore list.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-05

Initial public release of **leina** — Linked Engineering Intelligence Network for Agents.

### Graph
- Queryable code knowledge graph (SQLite via `node:sqlite`, zero native deps) with a
  freshness gate: `query`/`affected`/`path` auto-rebuild when sources changed.
- **11 languages**: TypeScript/TSX compiler-grade via ts-morph; JavaScript, Go, Python,
  Java, C#, Kotlin, Rust, Ruby and PHP via tree-sitter with import-guided resolution and
  receiver-type inference; optional Roslyn/JavaParser sidecars lift Java/C# to compiler
  grade (`sidecar build` locally, or `sidecar install` — sha256-verified prebuilt binaries).
- Per-file extraction cache (content-hash) for incremental rebuilds; `build --profile`
  reports per-stage timings. Word-wise query scoring (camelCase/snake_case subtokens).
- `impact analyze` (code→test→config→service), `audit` (source→sink reachability),
  workspace federation for multi-repo checkouts, offline HTML visualizers.

### Memory
- Always-on project memory (global DB keyed by a stable project key) with graph-anchored
  **drift detection**: `memory verified` classifies recalls as USABLE / WARNING / DO-NOT-USE.
- **Portable memory**: `memory export/import` (JSONL, deterministic merge) and
  `memory sync` with a committable `.leina/memory-export.jsonl` snapshot — decisions
  travel with the repo, no server.

### Agent integration
- **MCP server** (`leina mcp`, stdio): the versioned capability registry (17 contracts)
  exposed as 19 tools; `init --mcp` registers it in the project `.mcp.json`.
- Host-neutral advisory hook gate (consent-scoped, never blocks): Devin
  (`.devin/hooks.v1.json`) and Claude Code (`init --claude-hooks` →
  `.claude/settings.json`) share one gate; `AGENTS.md` protocol block for every host
  that reads it.
- Multi-host asset linking (`activate --hosts devin,claude`) from a versioned share, with
  selective installation from a catalog (`--preset minimal|sdd|full`, `--skills`,
  `--agents`) and dependency closure.
- Bundled skills/agents: SDD workflow (spec→design→tasks, impact-scoped), reviewers,
  PR workflows, docs aids.

### Install & operations
- One-shot `setup` ⟷ `disable`; granular `activate` ⟷ `deactivate`, `init` ⟷ `deinit`
  (adaptive LIGHT/FULL, tri-state per-repo consent, all writers idempotent + merge-safe).
- `doctor` (read-only diagnosis incl. Node floor, WASM parser assets, host links) and
  `repair` (re-runs the idempotent writers, respects opt-outs, never touches DBs).
- `leina tui` interactive console; `leina env` credential store under a names-not-values
  contract (0600, masked listings, `env exec` process-to-process injection).
- Node ≥ 22.13 gate at startup with version-manager advice; no install scripts —
  clean installs under npm, pnpm, bun and `--ignore-scripts`.
- CI on Linux/macOS/Windows × Node 22/24; provenance-attested release workflow.
